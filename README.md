# Career-Aspirations-of-Gen-Z
This project explores the career aspirations of Generation Z, highlighting their views on work-life balance, employer-employee relationships, and the values they seek in a workplace. It sheds light on the type of employment and organizations Gen Z prefers—those that align with their personal values, offer guidance and structure, and prioritize growth, recognition, and respect. 
The Project focuses on 3 main factors
1. Mission Aspirations:
  Mission Aspirations essentially refers to the desire of Gen Z to work for companies that align with their values and beliefs.
  They are more likely to be drawn to organizations that have a clear and meaningful mission, especially if it focuses
  on social responsibility, sustainability, or positive impact on society.
 For Gen Z, it’s not just about the job or salary—they want to be a part of something bigger.
 They are interested in working for companies that are not only financially successful but also ethically grounded
 and contribute to causes that resonate with their personal beliefs
